# Arithmetical priority

Example :
 2 ** 2 ** 1 + 9 * 7// 2
1 - Parenthesis ()
2 - Exponent **
3 - Unary + or - To indicate the sign of the number
4 - * / // %
5 - Binary + or - 
6 - Bitwise << >>
7 - AND &
8 - XOR ^
9 - OR |
10 - Membership and Identity in, not in, is, is not
11 - Relational < <= > >=
12 - Relationnal == !=
13 = += -= *= /= %= ^= |= >>= <<=
14 not
15 and
16 or

On case of same priority operator, most of them are left binded.
Exponent is right binded
